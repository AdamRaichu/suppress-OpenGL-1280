### Disclaimer: This mod does not actually fix any errors; it only prevents them from spamming the log

This mod prevents the OpenGL `GL_INVALID_ENUM` error from being logged more than once. If you know what that is, this is probably for you. If not, don't worry about it. This is a tool for people who read the debug log (mainly developers).

Click [here](https://github.com/AdamRaichu/suppress-OpenGL-1280/wiki) for more information on what that error is.

Since `v1.1.0`, it also suppresses `GL_INVALID_VALUE` and `GL_INVALID_OPERATION`. `v1.1.0` also adds a configuration screen, so be sure to download it if you still have `v1.0.0`.

Since `v1.2.0`, it also suppresses error #2.
